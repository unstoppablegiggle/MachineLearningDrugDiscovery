# Drug Discovery with Machine Learning
Drug Discovery Project using ML and large Chembly. Currently I have the data collected, processed, and curated.
Next steps involve using Lipinski factors to identify candidates. Primary issue is resolving a library discrepancy 
within the conda environment set up on Google colab preventing RDkit from working.
